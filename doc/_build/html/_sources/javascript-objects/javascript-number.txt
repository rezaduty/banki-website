JavaScript - The Number Object
===================


The ``Number`` object represents numerical date, either integers or floating-point numbers. In general, you do not need to worry about ``Number`` objects because the browser automatically converts number literals to instances of the number class.

Syntax
-------
The syntax for creating a ``number`` object is as follows âˆ’

var val = new Number(number);
In the place of number, if you provide any non-number argument, then the argument cannot be converted into a number, it returns ``NaN`` (Not-a-Number).

Number Properties
--------------------

Here is a list of each property and their description.

=================  ============
Method             Description
=================  ============
MAX_VALUE          The largest possible value a number in JavaScript can have 1.7976931348623157E+308
MIN_VALUE          The smallest possible value a number in JavaScript can have 5E-324
NaN     	       Equal to a value that is not a number.
NEGATIVE_INFINITY  A value that is less than MIN_VALUE.
POSITIVE_INFINITY  A value that is greater than MAX_VALUE
prototype          A static property of the Number object. Use the prototype property to assign new properties and methods to the Number object in the current document
constructor        Returns the function that created this object's instance. By default this is the Number object.
=================  ============


In the following sections, we will take a few examples to demonstrate the properties of Number.

Number Methods
--------------

The Number object contains only the default methods that are a part of every object's definition.

=================  ============
Method             Description
=================  ============
toExponential()    Forces a number to display in exponential notation, even if the number is in the range in which JavaScript normally uses standard notation.
toFixed()          Formats a number with a specific number of digits to the right of the decimal.
toLocaleString()   Returns a string value version of the current number in a format that may vary according to a browser's local settings.
toPrecision()      Defines how many total digits (including digits to the left and right of the decimal) to display of a number.
toString()         Returns the string representation of the number's value.
valueOf()          Returns the number's value.

In the following sections, we will have a few examples to explain the methods of Number.
