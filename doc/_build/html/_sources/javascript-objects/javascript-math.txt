JavaScript - The Math Object
===================

The ``math`` object provides you properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Unlike other global objects, ``Math`` is not a constructor. All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using ``Math`` as an object without creating it.

Thus, you refer to the constant ``pi`` as ``Math.PI`` and you call the sine function as ``Math.sin(x)``, where x is the method's argument.

Syntax
---------

The syntax to call the properties and methods of Math are as follows

.. code-block:: javascript

	var pi_val = Math.PI;
	var sine_val = Math.sin(30);
