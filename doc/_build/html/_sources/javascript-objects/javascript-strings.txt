JavaScript - The Strings Object
===================

The ``String`` object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.

As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.

Syntax
--------
Use the following syntax to create a String object âˆ’

.. code-block:: javascript

	var val = new String(string);

The ``String`` parameter is a series of characters that has been properly encoded.

String Properties
--------------------

Here is a list of the properties of String object and their description.

=============  =============
Property        Description
=============  =============
`constructor`    Returns a reference to the Boolean function that created the object.
`length`         Returns the length of the string.
`prototype`      The prototype property allows you to add properties and methods to an object.

In the following sections, we will have a few examples to demonstrate the usage of String properties.
