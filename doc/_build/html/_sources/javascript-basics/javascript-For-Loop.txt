JavaScript - For Loop
===================

The ``'for'`` loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following three important parts −

	→ The ``loop initialization`` where we initialize our counter to a starting value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.

	→ The ``test statement`` which will test if a given condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed, otherwise the control will come out of the loop.

	→ The ``iteration statement`` where you can increase or decrease your counter.

You can put all the three parts in a single line separated by semicolons.

Flow Chart

The flow chart of a for loop in JavaScript would be as follows

Syntax
The syntax of for loop is JavaScript is as follows −

.. code-block:: javascript

	for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
	   Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
	}

Example
~~~~~~~~~

Try the following example to learn how a for loop works in JavaScript.

.. code-block:: javascript

	<html>
	   <body>
	      
	      <script type="text/javascript">
	         <!--
	            var count;
	            document.write("Starting Loop" + "<br />");
	         
	            for(count = 0; count < 10; count++){
	               document.write("Current Count : " + count );
	               document.write("<br />");
	            }
	         
	            document.write("Loop stopped!");
	         //-->
	      </script>
	      
	      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
	   </body>
	</html>

Output::

	Starting Loop
	Current Count : 0
	Current Count : 1
	Current Count : 2
	Current Count : 3
	Current Count : 4
	Current Count : 5
	Current Count : 6
	Current Count : 7
	Current Count : 8
	Current Count : 9
	Loop stopped! 
	Set the variable to different value and then try...
