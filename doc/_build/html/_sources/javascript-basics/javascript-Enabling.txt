Enabling JavaScript in Browsers
===================

All the modern browsers come with built-in support for JavaScript. Frequently, you may need to enable or disable this support manually. This chapter explains the procedure of enabling and disabling JavaScript support in your browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, chrome, and Opera.

JavaScript in Internet Explorer
--------------------------

Here are simple steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in your Internet Explorer 

    → Follow Tools → Internet Options from the menu.

    → Select Security tab from the dialog box.

    → Click the Custom Level button.

    → Scroll down till you find Scripting option.

    → Select Enable radio button under Active scripting.

    → Finally click OK and come out

To disable JavaScript support in your Internet Explorer, you need to select Disable radio button under Active scripting.

JavaScript in Firefox
------------------------

Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Firefox −

    Open a new tab → type ``about: config`` in the address bar.

    Then you will find the warning dialog. Select ``I’ll be careful, I promise!``

    Then you will find the list of ``configure options`` in the browser.

    In the search bar, type ``javascript.enabled``.

    There you will find the option to enable or disable javascript by right-clicking on the value of that option → ``select toggle``.

If javascript.enabled is true; it converts to false upon clicking ``toogle``. If javascript is disabled; it gets enabled upon clicking toggle.


JavaScript in Chrome
------------------------

Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Chrome −

    → Click the Chrome menu at the top right hand corner of your browser.

    → Select ``Settings``.

    → Click ``Show advanced settings`` at the end of the page.

    → Under the ``Privacy`` section, click the Content settings button.

    → In the "Javascript" section, select "Do not allow any site to run JavaScript" or "Allow all sites to run JavaScript (recommended)".

JavaScript in Opera
-----------------------

Here are the steps to turn on or turn off JavaScript in Opera −

    → Follow ``Tools → Preferences`` from the menu.

    → Select ``Advanced`` option from the dialog box.

    → Select ``Content`` from the listed items.

    → Select ``Enable JavaScript`` checkbox.

    → Finally click OK and come out.

To disable JavaScript support in your Opera, you should not select the ``Enable JavaScript checkbox``.

Warning for Non-JavaScript Browsers
----------------------------------

If you have to do something important using JavaScript, then you can display a warning message to the user using ``<noscript>`` tags.

You can add a ``noscript`` block immediately after the script block as follows −

.. code-block:: javascript

	<html>
	   <body>
	      
	      <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
	         <!--
	            document.write("Hello World!")
	         //-->
	      </script>
	      
	      <noscript>
	         Sorry...JavaScript is needed to go ahead.
	      </noscript>
	      
	   </body>
	</html>

Now, if the user's browser does not support JavaScript or JavaScript is not enabled, then the message from </noscript> will be displayed on the screen.
