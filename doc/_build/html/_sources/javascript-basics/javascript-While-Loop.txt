JavaScript - While Loops
===================

While writing a program, you may encounter a situation where you need to perform an action over and over again. In such situations, you would need to write loop statements to reduce the number of lines.

JavaScript supports all the necessary loops to ease down the pressure of programming.

The while Loop
----------------

The most basic loop in JavaScript is the ``while`` loop which would be discussed in this chapter. The purpose of a ``while`` loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the ``expression`` becomes ``false``, the loop terminates.

Flow Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The flow chart of ``while loop`` looks as follows

Syntax
-----------

The syntax of ``while loop`` in JavaScript is as follows

.. code-block:: javascript

	while (expression){
	   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
	}

Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try the following example to implement while loop.

.. code-block:: javascript

	<html>
	   <body>
	      
	      <script type="text/javascript">
	         <!--
	            var count = 0;
	            document.write("Starting Loop ");
	         
	            while (count < 10){
	               document.write("Current Count : " + count + "<br />");
	               count++;
	            }
	         
	            document.write("Loop stopped!");
	         //-->
	      </script>
	      
	      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
	   </body>
	</html>

Output
~~~~~~~~~~~

	Starting Loop
	Current Count : 0
	Current Count : 1
	Current Count : 2
	Current Count : 3
	Current Count : 4
	Current Count : 5
	Current Count : 6
	Current Count : 7
	Current Count : 8
	Current Count : 9
	Loop stopped!
	Set the variable to different value and then try... 

The do...while Loop
------------------

The ``do...while`` loop is similar to the ``while`` loop except that the condition check happens at the end of the loop. This means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is ``false``.

Flow Chart
~~~~~~~~~~

The flow chart of a ``do-while`` loop would be as follows

.. image:: static/img/do_while_loop.jpg

Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~

The syntax for do-while loop in JavaScript is as follows −

.. code-block:: javascript

	do{
	   Statement(s) to be executed;
	} while (expression);

.. Note:: Don’t miss the semicolon used at the end of the do...while loop.

Example
~~~~~~~~~~~

Try the following example to learn how to implement a do-while loop in JavaScript.

.. code-block:: javascript

	<html>
	   <body>
	   
	      <script type="text/javascript">
	         <!--
	            var count = 0;
	            
	            document.write("Starting Loop" + "<br />");
	            do{
	               document.write("Current Count : " + count + "<br />");
	               count++;
	            }
	            
	            while (count < 5);
	            document.write ("Loop stopped!");
	         //-->
	      </script>
	      
	      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
	   </body>
	</html>

Output::
	Starting Loop
	Current Count : 0 
	Current Count : 1 
	Current Count : 2 
	Current Count : 3 
	Current Count : 4
	Loop Stopped!
	Set the variable to different value and then try...
